## Introduction

In the world of computer science, competitive programming is like a puzzle game where people solve problems using code. They have to solve these problems within a certain time. This guide will explain what competitive programming is, its history, how ranks work on a website called Codeforces, what Codeforces is, competitive programming sites and their owners, legends in competitive programming, types of topics encountered in competitive programming, similar sports to competitive programming, and how to get better at competitive programming.

## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming is about solving problems using code against others. People compete online or in person to solve these problems quickly and correctly. It's like a brain sport that mixes coding and problem-solving skills.

### Objectives of Competitive Programming:

1. **Problem Solving**: Competitive programming helps people get better at solving different kinds of problems with code.
  
2. **Efficiency and Optimization**: It teaches people to write code that works fast and doesn't use too much computer memory.

3. **Logic and Creativity**: Competitive programming encourages people to think logically and come up with creative solutions to tricky problems.

4. **Competitive Spirit**: While competing, people try to do better than others but still play fair and respectfully.

## History of Competitive Programming

Competitive programming started a long time ago when schools organized contests to help students get better at problem solving. Then, in the late 20th century, big competitions like the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) began. After that, online platforms like TopCoder, Codeforces, and AtCoder made competitive programming popular worldwide.

### Key Milestones:

1. **1977**: The ACM ICPC began, starting collegiate-level competitive programming.

2. **1998**: TopCoder started online competitions, making it easier for people to compete.

3. **2007**: Codeforces launched, becoming a favorite for many because of its easy-to-use website and many different kinds of problems.

4. **2013**: AtCoder became popular, especially in Japan.

   Meet Chibuoyim Ogbonna, also known as "madlogic," the self-proclaimed master of chaos in the world of competitive programming. Despite his years of experience in the field, Chibuoyim has yet to ascend to the prestigious ranks of grandmaster. Some say he's the living embodiment of Murphy's Law, where anything that can go wrong will go wrong—even his code.

   With his unconventional approach to problem-solving, Chibuoyim has managed to achieve the dubious honor of being a "Candidate Master" on Codeforces. Yes, you heard it right—a "Candidate Master" after all these years! It seems like he's mastered the art of being a candidate but hasn't quite nailed down the whole "master" part yet.

   Despite his less-than-stellar ranking, Chibuoyim remains undeterred, always ready to tackle new challenges with his trademark blend of madness and logic. Who knows? Maybe one day, he'll finally break free from the clutches of the "Candidate Master" title and ascend to the ranks of true greatness. But until then, we'll just sit back and enjoy the ride as madlogic continues to defy expectations and keep us all entertained with his antics in the world of competitive programming.


## Types of Topics Encountered in Competitive Programming

Competitive programming covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Data Structures**: These are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient manipulation and retrieval. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and heaps.

- **Algorithms**: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Topics such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms are commonly encountered in competitive programming.

- **Mathematics**: Mathematical concepts like number theory, combinatorics, probability, and geometry play a crucial role in solving many competitive programming problems.

- **String Processing**: Problems involving string manipulation, pattern matching, and text processing are common in competitive programming.
